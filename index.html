                <page-tile name="Browse" url="/services.html" color="color1">Building a application or a website? Why suffer through figuring out how to authorize and use all those fancy web services out there. C'mon in an check out some of the wrappers our users have created around other services: Google Drive, Facebook -- even those little services that everyone forgets about. All with easy to use APIs and features that make building and connecting services faster, easier and more scaleable.</page-tile>
                <page-tile name="Use" url="/docs/use.html" color="color2">Did you browse through our services and find something interesting? Great! Using it is as easy as calling two URLs. Don't worry about whether it's OAuth1 or OAuth2 or something more exotic -- it's all handled for you. And all the inputs and outputs are strongly typed, so you can figure out how to chain calls together. Images, locations, dates, music, temperature, currency, language, IP address... quickly connect services together to make the most of them.</page-tile>
                <page-tile name="Create" url="/upload.html" color="color3">Didn't find the service you were looking for? Bummer! That's kinda the problem with all these webservices -- nobody ever implements the one you want. That's okay though, take control of your own fate and create a service. No really, it's easy! Try out the API calls with Postman, and just export and upload the results to create a new service. Boom! Now you and everyone else can use it. Any smart services might even pick it up automatically.</page-tile>
                <page-tile name="About" url="/docs/about.html" color="color4">Ok, so this is still mostly a prototype. Maybe you want to know more about where this idea came from or where it's going? Check out our documentation for some background, and more details on how all the pieces work. If you have ideas, please share them -- collaboration is always fun. :)</page-tile>
